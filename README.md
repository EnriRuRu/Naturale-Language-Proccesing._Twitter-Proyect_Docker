# Naturale Language Proccesing
This project consists of developing a Natural Language Processing model to study the sentiment of Twitter messages:

1. I study several ways to approach the Twitter API, finally I extract the data with a library that does webscraping.

2. With the model provided by the statement, I study the tweets indicated with the previous text processing work so that the model is as effective as possible.

3. I answer the questions in the statement after applying the model and carrying out a small EDA

4. I create an APP using Flask with an endpoint to predict the sentiment of the text that is inserted.

5. I deploy it through Docker so it can be used by anyone. Later the image to Docke Hub.
